# Email_Filtering_&_Summarization_Using_LLMs
The main purpose of this task was to filter certain email in your outlook account and summarize the filtered emails, in thic script I am filtering only the email which are related with client asking for an insurance claim. Here I used Mistral 7B LLM through Ollama locally, but it can be changed according to the requiremnt.
I also used streamlit to make a GUI of this task as well, which is save in separate .py file.
